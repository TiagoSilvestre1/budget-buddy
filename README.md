## Prerequisites

Before getting started, you'll need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine. If you don't have these tools installed, please follow the installation instructions below:

- **Docker:** Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications using containers. To install Docker, follow the instructions for your operating system at [https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
- **Docker Compose:** Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. To install Docker Compose, follow the instructions for your operating system at [https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## Run project

### Development mode

Build and run the project in development mode:

```
sudo docker compose build
sudo docker compose up
```

The application will start in watch mode, allowing you to make changes to the code and see the updates in real time.

### Local mode

Build and run the project in local mode:

```
sudo docker compose -f docker-compose-local.yml build
sudo docker compose -f docker-compose-local.yml up
```

The difference between local and development modes is that the ip adresses will be local instead of lan

### Production mode

Build and run the project in production mode:

```
sudo docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-prod.yml build
sudo docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-prod.yml up
```

In production mode, the application will not be in watch mode and any changes to the code will require rebuilding and redeploying the containers.
